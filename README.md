## About the project
Previously, the volunteer organization conducted auctions manually, in social networks. It was inconvenient, confusing for users and not very effective.

      The main purpose of this platform is to create a simple user-interface for raising bids for a product, fixing these bids and receiving the participant's contact information.<br>
      <br>
      The platform should be easy for users, without registration, but with the possibility to make offers for bids.<br>
      <br>
      Bets can only be accepted while the timer is running.

For easier placing new bets without registration, when user made his first bet - user data is stored in cookies. And when user will make new offer - user data are added to input fields from cookies:

The website provides authentication only for volunteers. If the volunteer enters his login and password, he will be able to visit the page with a list of all bets and contact details of the participants:

<br>
On this page it is possible to change the exchange rate.<br>
This is necessary because ukrainian currency hryvnia can be understendible for users. Thats why I developed the functionality for accepting both currencies: in hryvnias (for Ukrainian users) and in dollars (for foreigners).<br>
This gives us the opportunity to conducting auctions all over the world and raise funds for the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine ðŸ’ªðŸ’™ðŸ’›
