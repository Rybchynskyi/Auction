Previously, the volunteer organization conducted auctions manually, in social networks. It was inconvenient, confusing for users and not very effective.

      The main purpose of this platform is to create a simple user-interface for raising bids for a product, fixing these bids and receiving the participant's contact information.<br>
      <br>
      The platform should be easy for users, without registration, but with the possibility to make offers for bids.<br>
      <br>
      Bets can only be accepted while the timer is running.

For easier placing new bets without registration, all user data is stored in cookies when user make the first bet. And then whe user will make new offer - user data are added to input fields from cookies:
