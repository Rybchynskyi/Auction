## About the project
Previously, the volunteer organization conducted auctions manually, in social networks. It was inconvenient, confusing for users and not very effective.

<table border="0">

    <td width="600">

      The main business-purpose of this platform is simple raising bids for a product fo users around the world. It must be with simple user-interface, without registration, but with the possibility for making offers for the bids and receiving the participant's contact information.<br>
      <br>
      Bets can only be accepted while the timer is running. New bet must be higher than the previous one.

 </tr>
</table>
<br>
For easier placing new bets without registration - user data is stored in cookies while user had made his first bet. When user will make new bet - user data are added to input fields from cookies:

The website provides authentication only for volunteers. If the volunteer enters his login and password, he will be able to visit the page with a list of all bets and contact details of the participants:

On this page it is possible to change the exchange rate.<br>
This is necessary because ukrainian currency hryvnia can be understendible for users. Thats why I developed the functionality for accepting both currencies: in hryvnias (for Ukrainian users) and in dollars (for foreigners).<br>
This gives us the opportunity to conducting auctions all over the world and raise funds for the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine ðŸ’ªðŸ’™ðŸ’›
